Developing High-Resolution Marine Weather Forecasts for
Tanzania Using an AI-Based Model
# Abstact
Accurate marine weather forecasts are critical for fisheries, maritime operations,and coastal management along Tanzania’s coastline. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, often struggle to capture fine-scale variability in coastal regions. This research aims to develop
a high-resolution marine weather forecasting framework by integrating WRF outputs with satellite observational data using deep learning, specifically Convolutional Long
Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) networks. The study involves preprocessing Satellite observational datasets, running WRF simulations, training ConvLSTM models, and validating forecasts against coastal station data. The expected outcome is an AI-enhanced forecasting system capable of providing more accurate and reliable predictions of marine weather forecasts including strong wind, strong waves, and Tropical Cyclone. This work will support sustainable fisheries, enhance maritime safety, and improve climate resilience along Tanzania’s coast, while demonstrating the potential of combining physics-based models with AI-driven prediction for marine weather applications .
